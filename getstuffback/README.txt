GetStuffBack 1.0
================

GetStuffBack is a simple applet that will remind you of stuff that people borrowed from you.

Requirements
============

* KDE 4.4 or above
* Python 2.5 or above
* PyQt 4.6 or above
* KDE bindings for Python ("PyKDE") for your KDE version.

Note: the applet has been extensively tested only on KDE 4.5.1 / Kubuntu 10.04 / Python 2.6. 

Installation
============

* From zip: plasmapkg -i getstuffback.zip
* From source (presuming you pulled the entire tree at http://github.com/toyg/plasmaapplets ): ./install-getstuffback.sh  

You can then right-click on your desktop, select Add Widget... and double-click to add the applet to desktop.
NOTE: this applet has been optimized for usage on a desktop/dashboard. Adding it to a Panel might give unpredictable results.

Usage
=====

Simply Add or Remove "loans", specifying the date you expect to get the stuff back. 
Once that date and a following "grace period" has passed, the loan will be highlighted as "overdue".
You can configure the "grace period" length (in days) and the highlighting colour.

====
